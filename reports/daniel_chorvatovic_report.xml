    <title>Query functionality in course project</title>
    <para>
        My task was to implement query functionality in our team's project. 
        The tool works with argument query [query from available queries].
        We store the queries in file "queries.properties" in resource pack of the project. 
        This makes the functionality easily extensible, we can add more queries just by enhancing the file.
        The tool executes xQuery over BaseX database and uses javax.xml.xquery API.
        Implementation of the tool is in QueryProcessor.java file that implements Processor interface defined for all the subtools.
        The query processor estabilishes connection with the database using configuration from database.properties, then runs a query against the database.
        If the query from the argument doesn't exist, the program will display a help message specifying available queries.
        Querying for specific CVs returns names of corresponding CVs, however, for query such as "contacts" we get 
        contacts of all the people in our database.
        CV names returned from query tool can be used in export tools, for example, when we query for 
        CVs with specific data in it, we can use the output for export_html function.
        In conclusion, I think the goal was accomplished and it fits the needs of specified query functionality.
