    <title>HTML Export functionality in the semestral project</title>
    <para>
        My task was to create java class which stores europass cvs in format XML to native XML database. 
        My part in this project was to implement export to HTML functionallity. This task can be set as two main objectives. 
        1) Creating XSLT for transforming europass XML files that are compliant with europass XML schema.
        2) Creating Java class responsible for calling and using XSLT Transformer.

        To make transformed HTML as much clean, simple and easy-to-read as possible, I used open-sourced, free to copy, use  and distribute, HTML/CSS CV template.
        I modified this template to suit needs of europass CVs. Then I created the XSLT for transforming europass XML files into HTML, using tags, classes and style from template. XSLT is written in a way, that it is easy to change, reorder or delete main sections of CV (educations, languages, work experience...) to best suit needs of HR team for further usage.

        For transformation with Java code, I used Saxon transformer, from package (net.sf.saxon). With this Saxon transformer and Java native package javax.xml.transform (Javaâ€™s abstract class for transforming trees) I managed to transform XMl files into HTML depeding on the command line arguments that are provided.
